Our agent uses the BlokusCoverProblem and calls a_star_search on this problem with our blokus_cover_heuristic.
the blokus_cover_heuristic return the distanse (in 8-connected measure) to the most far target from the covered tiles.
if one of the 4-connected to an uncovered target is covered our huristic return high score (board size)
